mess-with-splinter
==================

This is from me messing around with Splinter.py. 


This is a working example of Splinter that I I will use to demo browser regression testing. 


Instead of hacking away at the existing regression suite of projects I'm working on, my attempts and failures in regard to Splinter will be kept here.



To Run
======
python explore_trademe.py

Assumes that splinter is running on your python environment
